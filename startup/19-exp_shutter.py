# old control, abandoned in 2021C3
# These shutters are controlled by sending a 5V pulse via QEM output on the Delta Tau controller MC06 
# (the same unit that controls slits S5). Both the opening and closing of the shutter are triggered 
# by the rise of the pulse. 
#
# Note: 
# - PV for the QEM output on MC06 is: 
#	XF:11BMB-CT{MC:06}Asyn.AOUT
# - This PV is located under Slit 5/Asyn --> asynRecord/More... --> asynOctet interface I/O --> ASCII 
# - 'M112=1' sets the state to high
# - 'M112=0' sets the state to low
# - 'M111=1' launches the change in state
# - A sleep time of ~2 ms between successive caput commands is needed to get proper response; 1 ms is too short
